# Fictive

Have you ever wanted to test a running system to see if it can handle millions of records, but found that the large amount of data often confuses QA testers because it doesn’t look realistic? That’s exactly why Fictive is here — a solution to generate dummy data that actually feels real.

## How it Works

```
1. Setup and Initialize Fictive Functions
2. Parse schema
3. Call the method based on your needs
4. Validate and Normalize the Result of the Method.
5. Returning string as a result.

```

## Notes

```
Keep it simple stupid and don't overthink it.
```
